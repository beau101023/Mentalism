Make a simple 'interruptFocusC2S' packet and a focus interruption method in Focus

Implement hasModifier on Focus to check for duplicate modifier applications (to reproduce, spam click bell)

Spell ideas:
Air walk
Block break distance
Transmutation

Progression systems:
Distraction resistance types
Spells unlock when you focus up to a certain level while performing a certain action
Focuslevel increases

Early progression is only touch spells (within interaction range)
Higher focus level eventually makes it so the player can keep their eyes open while focusing
Mid-progression gives projectiles
high progression gives you some shit idk, something cool
