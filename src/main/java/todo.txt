Utility emphasis



- Make 'focus bar' of some kind
- Implement distraction resistances
- Moar spells
- add biden blast sound effect

x Implement unlock system
x Make seeing while casting unlockable
x Implement hasModifier on Focus to check for duplicate modifier applications
x Use lerp instead of the nonstandard stuff I'm using currently

Spell ideas:
Air walk
Block break distance
Transmutation

Progression systems:
Distraction resistance types
Spells unlock when you focus up to a certain level while performing a certain action
Focuslevel increases

Early progression is only touch spells (within interaction range)
Higher focus level eventually makes it so the player can keep their eyes open while focusing
Mid-progression gives projectiles
high progression gives you some shit idk, something cool
